# BMI_Calculator_Python
A simple Python program that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a userâ€™s weight and height. The program accepts height in either meters or centimeters, automatically converts it if needed, and classifies the result into categories: Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, or Obesity. It runs in a loop, allowing multiple calculations.

This version will:

Take weight in kilograms.

Take height in either meters OR centimeters (your choice).

Convert automatically if needed.

Show BMI + category.

Run in a loop until you say no.

End with a thank you message.
