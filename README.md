# BMI_Calculator_Python
A simple Python program that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a userâ€™s weight and height. The program accepts height in either meters or centimeters, automatically converts it if needed, and classifies the result into categories: Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, or Obesity. It runs in a loop, allowing multiple calculations.
